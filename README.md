# MultipleTab
There are multiple website which we open daily before we start our work, be it facebook, youtube, github or some other.  To open each website in different tab is time consuming. So we have developed an extension which will automate this.

How it will work?

* We will create an extension which will store all the required urls in a text area. Whenever user wants to open the urls just they have to click a button. And it will open all the website in different tab of your browser.

* User can add the current tab URL which they thing that it is needed daily by just clicking an Add button, which will add the current active webpage URL.

* It will store all the urls which have been added previously so that user donâ€™t have to add the urls every time.

Why to use?

This will save time for opening the daily use website in browser.

Enjoy Using... :)
